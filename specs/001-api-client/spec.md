# Feature Specification: CanadianSupermarketApi Client — Product Search, Store Listing, Product Details

**Feature Branch**: `001-api-client`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Approved
**Input**: User description: "Create a new branch called 001-api-client that will set up the CanadianSupermarketApi client which will expose functions to search the supermarket for a listing of products, search supermarkets for specific stores at specific locations, and to get product details based on a given id from a specific store."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As an application developer, I need a client that lets me search products (by text or known id), list available stores, and fetch product details for a specific store so that I can power higher‑order product/grocery/meal‑prep workflows in my downstream application.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a keyword query or known product id, when I search products scoped to a required storeId, then I receive a paginated list where each item includes at minimum product name, brand (if available), size/unit, indicative price in CAD, and a product identifier suitable for detail retrieval.
2. Given user‑specified pagination inputs (page number and page size), when I search products, then I receive results constrained to the requested page along with total count if available; ordering is stable for a given input.
3. Given an invalid parameter (e.g., missing storeId, invalid page/pageSize), when I search products, then I receive a clear validation error describing the issue.
4. Given no inputs, when I list stores for the Superstore banner, then I receive the full list of available stores including store id, name, address, coordinates, pickup type, and an indicator for open now when determinable.
5. Given a valid product id and store id, when I fetch product details, then I receive product name, brand, size/unit, current price in CAD, regular price when present, unit comparison price when available, and any available imagery/description. Availability fields are included when present from upstream.
6. Given a product id that exists chain‑wide but is not carried in the specified store, when I fetch details, then I receive a not‑found response scoped to the store (not a generic error).
7. Given required credentials are missing or invalid, when I invoke any operation, then I receive a clear authorization/credentials error without ambiguous partial results.

### Edge Cases

- Empty or overly broad product queries return zero results with guidance (no partial, misleading data).
- Queries with special characters or non‑Latin scripts are handled safely with either results or clear validation.
- Missing prices or unavailable products return results with explicit fields indicating missing/unknown values.
- Product identifiers are assumed chain‑wide; if not available at a store, treat as store‑scoped not‑found.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The system MUST support keyword‑ or id‑based product search with user‑specified pagination.
- FR-002: The system MUST require a storeId to scope product search and product detail retrieval.
- FR-003: The system MUST list all available stores for the Superstore banner with essential fields (store id, name, address, coordinates, pickup type, openNow when determinable).
- FR-004: The system MUST retrieve product details by product id within the context of a specific store id.
- FR-005: The system MUST represent all prices in CAD and include currency in outputs, returning all pricing information provided by upstream (current, regular/was, unit comparison when available).
- FR-006: The system MUST produce clear validation errors for invalid parameters and not‑found outcomes for unknown product/store combinations.
- FR-007: The system MUST define stable, supermarket‑agnostic request/response contracts to permit future addition of other supermarkets without breaking clients.
- FR-008: The system MUST distinguish chain context and store context explicitly in responses (e.g., include chain info where relevant and always include store id for store‑scoped data).
- FR-009: The system MUST avoid embedding implementation specifics or sensitive upstream tokens in its public contract, and instead expose only derived, stable fields.
- FR-010: The system SHOULD provide stable ordering for search results for a given input; explicit sort/filter controls are out of scope for v1.
- FR-011: The system MUST require user‑provided credentials/keys where needed and must not ship embedded credentials; missing credentials produce a clear error.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)

- Product: A sellable item; key attributes include product id, name, brand (optional), size/unit, category, price (amount + currency CAD), images/description (if available), and store availability when provided.
- Store: A physical retail location; key attributes include store id, name, address, coordinates, chain identifier/name, and optional hours.
- Price: Monetary amount with currency CAD and, where appropriate, effective/as‑of information.
- Search Query: Query string, required storeId, and pagination parameters (page, pageSize).

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Source supermarket: Real Canadian Superstore only for this iteration; future supermarkets may be added without breaking existing contracts.
- Access method: Upstream endpoints are unofficial/reverse‑engineered; behavior may change without notice. Credentials/keys must be supplied by the integrator; the system will not embed or procure them.
- Currency: All prices are represented in CAD.
- Pricing: Displayed prices exclude tax; downstream consumers are responsible for handling tax calculations.
- Availability: Product availability is store‑scoped; a product may exist chain‑wide but not be available at a given store. Availability fields are passed through when present from upstream.
- Images: Provide a primary image when available; no specific resolution requirement in v1.
